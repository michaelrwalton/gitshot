# Todo
Not ordered in any sort of priority (maybe naturally most interesting to least? idk)

- Make work on other platforms! That means removing `imagesnap` in favor for a universal solution.
- Fix it so post-commit hooks aren't overwritten
- Better way to background the image taking
- Some kind of tests
- Easier way to insert twitter keys. Maybe a semi automatic way to make a personal Twitter app?
- Ideally remove pip/tweepy dependency for ultimate portability
- Maybe upload to other things?
- Facial recognition and sentiment analysis might be funny
