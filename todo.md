# Todo
Not ordered in any sort of priority (maybe natrually most interesting to least? idk)

- Make work on other platforms! That means removing `imagesnap` in favor for a universal solution.
- Easier way to insert twitter keys. Maybe a semi automatic way to make a personal Twitter app?
- Ideally remove pip/tweepy dependency for ultimate portability
- Maybe upload to other things?
- Facial rSentiment analysis might be funny
